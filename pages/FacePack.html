        <p>A "face pack" is a thick paste or cream-like substance applied to the face, designed to deeply 
              cleanse the skin by absorbing impurities, unclogging pores, and providing targeted benefits like hydration, brightening,
              or reducing oiliness, depending on the ingredients used; essentially, it's a more concentrated
              treatment compared to a regular facial cleanser, leaving skin looking smoother and clearer after removal. </p>

             <h3><u>Key benefits of using a face pack</u> </h3>   
             <ol style="line-height: 50px;">
                <li><b> Deep cleansing:</b> Effectively removes dirt, oil, and dead skin cells from deep within the pores, promoting a clearer complexion. </li>
                <li><b>Exfoliation:</b> Some face packs contain gentle exfoliating particles to further refine skin texture. </li>
                <li><b>Hydration boost:</b> Moisturizing ingredients can deeply hydrate dry skin, leaving it supple and plump.  </li>
                <li><b>Skin brightening:</b> Certain ingredients like vitamin C or licorice extract can help lighten dark spots and even out skin tone.        </li>
                <li><b>Anti-aging effects:</b> Some face packs include antioxidants or peptides to combat signs of aging like wrinkles and fine lines.               </li>
                <li><b>Oil control: </b>Clay-based packs can absorb excess oil, making them suitable for oily skin types. </li>
                <li><b>Detoxification:</b> Certain ingredients like bentonite clay can draw out toxins from the skin. </li>
            </ol>
