        <p>A "face pack" is a thick paste or cream-like substance applied to the face, designed to deeply 
              cleanse the skin by absorbing impurities, unclogging pores, and providing targeted benefits like hydration, brightening,
              or reducing oiliness, depending on the ingredients used; essentially, it's a more concentrated
              treatment compared to a regular facial cleanser, leaving skin looking smoother and clearer after removal. </p>
