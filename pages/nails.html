        <h3><u>Nail and Skin Health:</u></h3>

        <ol class="description">
            <li><b>Prevents Infections:</b>Regular manicures help keep nails clean and trimmed, reducing the risk of fungal and bacterial infections that can occur when dirt and bacteria accumulate under the nails or in cuts and bruises. </li>
            <li><b>Promotes Healthy Nail Growth:</b> By trimming and shaping nails, manicures help prevent nail damage and breakage, allowing nails to grow strong and healthy. </li>
            <li><b>Reduces Risk of Ingrown Nails:</b> Proper nail trimming and cuticle care during manicures can help prevent ingrown nails, a painful condition that can occur when the nail grows into the surrounding skin. </li>
            <li><b>Removes Dead Skin:</b>Manicures involve exfoliating and removing dead skin cells around the nails, which helps prevent buildup and promotes smoother, healthier skin. </li>
            <li><b>Improves Blood Circulation:</b>The massage and gentle handling of hands during a manicure can improve blood circulation, which can lead to healthier skin and a more youthful appearance. </li>
         </ol>
