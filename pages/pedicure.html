        <h3><u>Foot Hygiene and Health:</u></h3>

        <ol style="line-height: 50px;">
            <li><b>Cleanliness:</b>Pedicures involve thorough cleaning and sanitization of the feet, removing dirt, sweat, and dead skin cells that can accumulate from daily activities.  </li>
            <li><b>Nail Health:</b> Regular pedicures help keep nails trimmed and shaped, reducing the risk of ingrown toenails and fungal infections.  </li>
            <li><b>Calluses and Cracked Heels:</b>Pedicures can help address and prevent calluses, rough spots, and cracked skin, which can lead to sores and infections.  </li>
            <li><b>Early Detection of Problems:</b>Pedicures can help identify early signs of foot problems like fungal infections, corns, and bunions, allowing for timely treatment.  </li>
            <li><b>Improved Circulation:</b>The massage component of a pedicure can stimulate blood flow, which is important for the health of the skin and nails, as well as the overall foot. </li>
         </ol>
         <ol>   
            <h3><u>Skin Health and Appearance:</u></h3>

  
            <li><b>Exfoliation:</b>Pedicures involve exfoliating dead skin cells, leaving feet feeling smooth and soft. </li>
            <li><b>Moisturization:</b>Pedicures often include moisturizing treatments, which can help prevent dry, cracked skin. </li>
            <li><b>Improved Appearance:</b>Healthy, well-cared-for feet contribute to overall appearance and confidence. </li>
        </ol>

            <h3><u>Relaxation and Stress Relief:</u></h3>
