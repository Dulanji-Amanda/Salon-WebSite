        <h3><u>Foot Hygiene and Health:</u></h3>

        <ol class="description">
            <li><b>Cleanliness:</b>Pedicures involve thorough cleaning and sanitization of the feet, removing dirt, sweat, and dead skin cells that can accumulate from daily activities.  </li>
            <li><b>Nail Health:</b> Regular pedicures help keep nails trimmed and shaped, reducing the risk of ingrown toenails and fungal infections.  </li>
            <li><b>Calluses and Cracked Heels:</b>Pedicures can help address and prevent calluses, rough spots, and cracked skin, which can lead to sores and infections.  </li>
            <li><b>Early Detection of Problems:</b>Pedicures can help identify early signs of foot problems like fungal infections, corns, and bunions, allowing for timely treatment.  </li>
            <li><b>Improved Circulation:</b>The massage component of a pedicure can stimulate blood flow, which is important for the health of the skin and nails, as well as the overall foot. </li>
         </ol>
